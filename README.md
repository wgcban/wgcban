## Projects

I have been working on several projects related to computer vision and deep learning, and I am always looking for new projects to work on. Some of my recent projects include:

- [AdaMAE: Adaptive Masking for Efficient Spatiotemporal Learning with Masked Autoencoders](https://github.com/wgcban/adamae)
- [ChangeFormer: A Transformer-Based Siamese Network for Change Detection](https://github.com/wgcban/ChangeFormer)
- [DDPM-CD: Remote Sensing Change Detection using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://github.com/wgcban/ddpm-cd)
- [Revisiting Consistency Regularization for Semi-supervised Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images](https://github.com/wgcban/SemiCD)
- [HyperTransformer: A Textural and Spectral Feature Fusion Transformer for Pansharpening (CVPR'22)](https://github.com/wgcban/HyperTransformer)
