## Projects

I have been working on several projects related to computer vision and deep learning, and I am always looking for new projects to work on. Some of my recent projects include:

- [AdaMAE: Adaptive Masking for Efficient Spatiotemporal Learning with Masked Autoencoders (CVPR'23)](https://github.com/wgcban/adamae)
- [``Unite and Conquer: Cross Dataset Multimodal Synthesis using Diffusion Models (CVPR'23)``](https://nithin-gk.github.io/projectpages/Multidiff/index.html)
- [``ChangeFormer: A Transformer-Based Siamese Network for Change Detection (IGARSS'22)``](https://github.com/wgcban/ChangeFormer)
- [``DDPM-CD: Remote Sensing Change Detection using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models``](https://github.com/wgcban/ddpm-cd)
- [``Revisiting Consistency Regularization for Semi-supervised Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images``](https://github.com/wgcban/SemiCD)
- [``HyperTransformer: A Textural and Spectral Feature Fusion Transformer for Pansharpening (CVPR'22)``](https://github.com/wgcban/HyperTransformer)
